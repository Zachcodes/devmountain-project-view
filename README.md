This project will allow all students that have graduated from DevMountain to display the projects that they've worked so hard on so that potential future employers and current/prospective students can view them. Most of the projects that students make are viewed by their classmates and employers that they show or may view their portfolios but there is not currently a centralized place to view all these projects. That's what this project aims to solve.
